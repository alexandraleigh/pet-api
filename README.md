# Pet API
I am passionate about rescuing pets and web developments. This is a side project I created to combine the two. It is an adoptable pet database modeled after sites like Petfinder and Adopt-a-Pet. My main goal is to learn more about creating RESTful JSON APIs with Rails 5. This is a work in progress!

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
